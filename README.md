[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Channel-FF0000?style=social&logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/@techstackmedia)

A complete setup guide including Brewfile, Git, shell configuration (e.g., `.zshrc`), package managers (npm/bun), and environment variables for Mac.

---

## 1. Switch to `zsh` Shell (Optional but Recommended)

To confirm the default shell:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

List all available shells:

```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

To switch to `zsh` (if not already using it):

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

You may need to restart your terminal session for changes to take effect.

---

## 2. Download Project ZIP Files from GitHub

Download the movie app and API project ZIP files to the `Documents` directory:

### Movie App

```bash
cd ~/Documents
curl -L -o react-native-projects.zip https://github.com/techstackspace/react-native-projects/archive/refs/heads/feature/01-movie-collection-app.zip
unzip react-native-projects.zip
cd ~/Documents/react-native-projects-feature-01-movie-collection-app
```

### API

The backend code is available in the [feature/01-movie-collection-api](https://github.com/techstackspace/express-projects/tree/feature/01-movie-collection-api) branch.

```bash
cd ~/Documents
curl -L -o express-projects.zip https://github.com/techstackspace/express-projects/archive/refs/heads/feature/01-movie-collection-api.zip
unzip express-projects.zip
cd ~/Documents/express-projects-feature-01-movie-collection-api
```

---

## 3. Install Homebrew (If Not Installed)

Install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

---

## 4. Brewfile Installation

### If `Brewfile` is in the same directory:

```bash
brew bundle
```

### If `Brewfile` is in another directory:

```bash
brew bundle --file=~/Documents/react-native-projects-feature-01-movie-collection-app/Brewfile
```

Feel free to modify the `Brewfile` to add or remove dependencies as needed.

---

## 5. Preventing Unnecessary React Imports

If the **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets** extension for **VS Code** still imports **React** as:

```tsx
import React from 'React'
```

In such case the extension is still using the old **React 17** import style, even though you are likely using **React 18+**, which no longer requires this import statement in most cases.

To prevent this redundant import, add the following settings to your **User settings.json** or create a **`.vscode/settings.json`** file in your project directory:

```json
{
  "javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "non-relative",
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "non-relative",
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact",
    "typescript": "typescriptreact"
  },
  "reactSnippets.settings.importReactOnTop": false
}
```

> Restart VS Code to apply the changes if the code was added to your **User settings.json**.

---

## 6. Enable Format on Save (Prettier)

To automatically format your code on save, ensure you have the **Prettier - Code formatter** extension installed in **VS Code**. Then, add the following to your projectâ€™s **`.vscode/settings.json`** file:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

This setting will ensure your code is consistently formatted every time you save.

**Optional:** Create a **`.prettierrc`** file in your project root to customize Prettierâ€™s behavior. For example:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": false
}
```

This approach keeps your codebase clean and readable, aligning with industry best practices.

---

## 7. Install Dependencies

### Using Bun (preferred):

```bash
bun install
```

### Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

> Delete `bun.lockb` if switching to `npm` via `nvm`.

---

## 8. Set Up Git (If Not Already Configured)

Check Git configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

If needed, configure Git globally:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

---

## 9. Uninstall Brewfile Apps

To remove all installed apps not in the Brewfile:

```bash
brew bundle cleanup --force
```

Alternatively, delete unwanted apps manually or remove entries from the `Brewfile` and rerun the command above.

---

## 10. Install `nvm` or `bum`

### Install `nvm`:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

> Replace `v0.40.3` with the [latest release version](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases).

### Install `bum`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/owenizedd/bum/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## 11. Environment Variable Configuration for Android and `nvm`

Edit your `~/.zprofile` and add the following between **Amazon Q pre block** and **Amazon Q post block**:

```bash
# Amazon Q pre block

# Brew environment variable

# Android SDK Setup
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# nvm Setup
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # Loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # Loads bash_completion for nvm

# bum Setup (Bun Version Manager)
export BUM_DIR="$HOME/.bum"
export PATH="$BUM_DIR/bin:$PATH"

# Load bum-managed Bun version (if any)
if [ -f "$BUM_DIR/version" ]; then
  BUN_VERSION=$(cat "$BUM_DIR/version")
  export PATH="$BUM_DIR/versions/$BUN_VERSION/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Amazon Q post block
```

Then apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile
```

---

## 12. Running the React Native Project

To start the React Native project, use:

```bash
bun start
```

For iOS:

```bash
i
```

For Android:

```bash
a
```

To run on a physical device, scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using the Expo app or your iPhone camera (recommended for accurate testing).
