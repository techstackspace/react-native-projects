## Hook Signature

| movieId   | `string` | ID of the movie to fetch |

## Returned Values

| Key     | Type                      | Description                     |

## Behavior

* **Fetch on ID Change:** When the `movieId` changes, the hook triggers a new fetch request.
* **Loading State:** `loading` is `true` while the movie is being fetched.
* **Error Handling:** Errors during the fetch are caught and stored in the `error` state.
* **Result Storage:** The fetched movie is stored in the `movie` state variable once loaded.
