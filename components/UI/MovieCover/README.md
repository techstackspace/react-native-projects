## Component Props

This component does not accept external props directly. It uses internal hooks to derive the movie data:

| Hook                   | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `useLocalSearchParams` | Extracts the `id` parameter from the route |
| `useMovie(id)`         | Fetches movie data including `posterUrl`   |

## Behavior

* **Poster Display:** Uses the movieâ€™s `posterUrl` as the background image, covering 50% of the screen height.
* **Play Button Overlay:** A circular white play button is overlaid near the bottom-right corner of the image.
* **SVG Icon Gradient:** The play icon inside the button is styled using a linear gradient via `react-native-svg`.
* **Absolute Positioning:** The play button is positioned with `absolute`, offset from the bottom and right of the image.
