## Component Props

This component does not receive any external props. It retrieves the movie ID from the route params using `useLocalSearchParams` and fetches the data using a custom `useMovie` hook.

## Behavior

* **Movie Title & Basic Info**: Displays the movie title, release year, certification, and duration.
* **Rating Display**: Shows the average rating and total number of ratings in compact format (e.g., `1.2K`, `4.3M`).
* **Overview Section**: Presents a description/overview of the movie.
* **Date Formatting**: Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to present a user-friendly full release date (e.g., May 26, 2019).
* **Genres Display**: Renders each genre as a pill-shaped styled text component.
* **Countries & Production Companies**: Renders lists with dots as separators for better readability.
* **Currency Formatting**: Converts numeric budget and revenue strings to abbreviated currency format (e.g., `$150 million`, `$1.2 billion`).
* **Responsive Layout**: Uses flex layout for sections like release/budget, and country/production info to maintain structure.

## UI Highlights

* All text color, spacing, and background styling is theme-consistent using values from `constants`.
* Genre and rating sections are styled as badges for quick visual parsing.
* `Container` component used for layout margin and consistency with other screens.
